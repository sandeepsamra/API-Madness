API Madness
=============

This was a Lighthouse Labs assignment designed to help us learn how to use external APIs. I used the LCBO API so that a user can search for drinks using this app. The results start loading as soon as the user types in at least three characters.

Built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS (Bootstrap).

This is still a work in progress.
